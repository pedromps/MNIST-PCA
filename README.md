# MNIST-PCA
Trying out PCA for a larger dataset, to increase contact with this method and to check out how explained variance changes with the amount of components (from 1 component to #features-1 components). The resulting plot is in included in this repository.


One particularity is that this was done for a .csv file with the MNIST data pixel per pixel and it could have been applied to the images as well, which is probably a new part to try and introduce into this project.


There's also a segment of code for a classifier for this dataset. It achieved 99% accuracy in the training set and the architecture's design comes from an assignment I had back in University where the diagram of the network was given and we had to code it in Python.
